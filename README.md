# Multilingual Language Translation System

This is a multilingual language translation system built using Streamlit. It takes a text input from the user and predicts the language of the text.

You can check the Streamlit app from the below link : [WebApp link](https://multilingualproject.streamlit.app/)


## Code

The code for the system is as follows:

you can check : main_app.py

## Explanation of the code

The code is divided into two sections: the Streamlit code and the Python code.

The Streamlit code is responsible for the user interface of the system. It creates a form where the user can enter a text and click the "Submit" button to predict the language of the text.

The Python code is responsible for the prediction logic. It loads the language translation dataset, trains a LinearSVC model on the dataset, and predicts the language of the text entered by the user.

## How to use the system

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Open the system in your browser.
2. Enter a text in the text input field.
3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. The system will predict the language of the text and display the result in a message.

## Limitations of the system

The system is a basic example of a multilingual language translation system. It has the following limitations:

* It only supports a small number of languages.
* It is not very accurate.
* It can be slow to predict the language of a text.

## Future work

The following are some possible ways to improve the system:

* Add support for more languages.
* Improve the accuracy of the system.
* Make the system faster.
* Add a feature to allow the user to translate a text from one language to another.
